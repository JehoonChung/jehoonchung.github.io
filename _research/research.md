### Guaranteeing Home Insurance: Evidence from California’s Wildfire Safety and Recovery Act
This paper examines the impact of home insurance availability on households by exploiting zip code-level variation in insurance cancellations introduced by California’s Wildfire Safety and Recovery Act (SB 824). Using a difference-in-differences design with multiple treatments, I compare households in protected zip codes to those just outside its coverage. I hypothesize that guaranteed insurance reduces delinquency and bankruptcy. However, I expect a decrease in long-term insurance supply and a rise in premiums, disproportionately affecting low-income households.

### The Real Effects of Green Corporate Restructuring
Using U.S. EPA plant-level data, I show that heightened environmental risk is associated with an increased probability of asset sales, driven by financial constraints, state regulatory spikes, and low divestiture costs. Selling firms improve operating performance and firm value but with no clear greenwashing motives in plant sales. However, sold plants exhibit declines in workplace safety and environmental efficiency, unintentionally worsening sustainability conditions.
