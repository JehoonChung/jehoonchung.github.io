## Research Identity (as of May 2025)
I position my research within the tradition of structured reduced-form empirical work that combines rich identification strategies with economic theory to deliver deeply policy-relevant insights. I belive my comparative advantage lies in identifying real-world questions and framing them through the lens of economic theory. I however, recognize that working on salient policy topics often invites time-sensitive competition. To complement my empirical strengths and extend the reach of my research, I am actively pursuing training in structural modeling and estimation, with the goal of quantifying welfare implications and offering fully grounded policy recommendations.

## Working Papers

We examine how credit relief from temporarily guaranteed home insurance propogate through household balance sheets.

### The Real Effects of Green Corporate Restructuring
