### Guaranteeing Home Insurance: Evidence from California’s Wildfire Safety and Recovery Act
This paper examines the impact of home insurance availability on households by leveraging zip-code-level variation introduced by California’s Wildfire Safety and Recovery Act (SB 824). Using a difference-in-differences design with multiple treatments, I compare households in protected zip codes to those just outside its coverage within the same county. I hypothesize that while provisional insurance may temporarily reduce delinquency and mortgage debt, it could lead insurers to tighten underwriting standards and raise premiums. Preliminary evidence suggests a decline in long-term insurance availability, potentially disproportionately affecting financially constrained households.

### The Real Effects of Green Corporate Restructuring
Using U.S. EPA plant-level data, I show that heightened environmental risk is associated with an increased probability of asset sales, driven by financial constraints, state regulatory spikes, and low divestiture costs. Selling firms improve operating performance and firm value but with no clear greenwashing motives in plant sales. However, sold plants exhibit declines in workplace safety and environmental efficiency, unintentionally worsening sustainability conditions.
