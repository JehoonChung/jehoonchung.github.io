## Research Identity
I position my research in structured reduced-form empirical work, combining rich identification with economic theory to deliver policy-relevant insights. I belive my comparative advantage is identifying real-world questions and framing them theoretically. To extend the reach of my research, I am pursuing training in structural estimation to quantify welfare implications and provide fully grounded policy recommendations.

### The Real Effects of Green Corporate Restructuring
