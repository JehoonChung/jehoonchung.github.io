I position my research in reduced-form empirical work that address policy-relevant questions. I am particularly interested in settings where institutional frictions and behavioral responses shape financial outcomes. To extend the scope of my work, I am working to integrate structural estimation to capture underlying mechanisms and quantify welfare implications.


## Working Papers

### [1] Guaranteeing Home Insurance: Evidence from Californiaâ€™s Wildfire Moratorium
*with Rustom Irani and Ralf Meisenzahl*

We examine how credit relief from temporary insurance protection propagates through household balance sheets and mortgage outcomes.

### [2] The Real Effects of Green Corporate Restructuring
*Master Thesis*

I identify the effect of heightened environmental risks on corporate divestitures and the implications on firm value and local sustainability.
