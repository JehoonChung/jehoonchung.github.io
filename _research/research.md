I position my research within the tradition of structured reduced-form empirical work. Motivated by a strong interest in exploring real-world questions through the lens of economic theory, I value research that generates meaningful policy insights. To extend the reach of my work, I am pursuing training in structural modeling to quantify welfare implications and deliver fully grounded policy recommendations.
