I position my research in structured reduced-form empirical work that delivers policy-relevant insights. I am paricularly interested in exploring real-world questions through the lens of economic theory. To broaden the impact of my work, I am pursuing training in structural modeling to quantify welfare implications and provide fully grounded policy recommendations.

### [2] The Real Effects of Green Corporate Restructuring
