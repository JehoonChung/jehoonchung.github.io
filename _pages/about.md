I am a finance graduate student at Gies College of Business, UIUC. My research focuses on the intersection of corporate finance, household finance, and environmental economics, examining how environmental risks impact financial decision-making and socioeconomic outcomes.

My current project, "Guaranteeing Home Insurance: Evidence from Californiaâ€™s Wildfire Safety and Recovery Act," examines how the availability of home insurance influences household credit and mortgage outcomes while addressing implications for insurance market dynamics.

Previously, I wrote my master's thesis at Korea University, "The Real Effects of Green Corporate Restructuring," which investigated how heightened environmental risks drive corporate divestitures and the implications of these decisions on firm value and local sustainability.

Here is the link to my [CV](/files/CV_JehoonChung.pdf).
