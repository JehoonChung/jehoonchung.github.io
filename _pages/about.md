Welcome! I am a second-year Finance PhD student and Robert J. Waller Doctoral Fellow at the Kelley School of Business, Indiana University.

My primary research focus is on corporate, household, and climate finance. I am currently interested in the transmission of environmental risks through financial markets under regulatory frictions.

Before joining Kelley, I earned a Bachelor's in Business Administration and Financial Engineering from Korea University, as well as a Masterâ€™s in Finance from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.
