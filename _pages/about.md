Welcome! I am a second-year Finance PhD student at the Kelley School of Business, Indiana University.

My primary research interests are in corporate, household, and climate finance, with a focus on the transmission of environmental risks through financial markets and how regulatory frictions shape the distribution of these costs.

Prior to joining Kelley, I earned a Bachelor's in Business Administration and Financial Engineering from Korea University, as well as a Masterâ€™s in Finance from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.
