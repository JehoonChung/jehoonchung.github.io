Welcome! I am a Finance PhD student and Robert J. Waller Doctoral Fellow at the Kelley School of Business, Indiana University.

My research interests lie in empirical corporate finance, with a focus on (i) how environmental risks influence firm decision-making and (ii) how financial institutions transmit these risks. More recently, I have also developed an interest in innovation and entrepreneurship and remain open to exploring and learning from new research areas.

Before joining Kelley, I earned a Bachelor's in Business Administration and Financial Engineering from Korea University, as well as a Masterâ€™s in Finance from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.
