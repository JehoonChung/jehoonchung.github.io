Welcome! I am a second-year Finance Ph.D. student at the Kelley School of Business, Indiana University. My research focuses on climate finance, corporate finance, and real estate, with an emphasis on how firms and financial intermediaries reallocate environmental risks and the resulting economic implications.

Prior to joining Kelley, I earned a Bachelor's in Business Administration and Financial Engineering from Korea University, as well as a Masterâ€™s in Finance from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.
