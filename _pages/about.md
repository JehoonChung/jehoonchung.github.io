Welcome! I am a second-year Finance Ph.D. student at the Kelley School of Business, Indiana University Bloomington. My research interests include corporate, household, and climate finance, with a focus on how financial decisions and policies related to environmental risks affect socioeconomic outcomes. 

Before joining Kelley, I earned a B.A. and M.S. in Business Administration from Korea University and an M.S. in Finance from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.

You can find my CV [here](/files/CV_JehoonChung.pdf) and contact me at <a href="mailto:chunje@iu.edu">chunje@iu.edu</a>
