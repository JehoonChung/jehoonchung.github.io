Welcome! I am a Finance PhD student and Robert J. Waller Doctoral Fellow at the Kelley School of Business, Indiana University.

My research interests are in empirical corporate finance, focusing on how environmental risks affect firm behavior and how financial institutions transmit these risks to households. I am also developing interests in innovation and entrepreneurship as part of my doctoral studies.

Before joining Kelley, I earned a Bachelor's in Business Administration and Financial Engineering from Korea University, as well as a Masterâ€™s in Finance from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.
