Welcome! I am a Finance PhD student and Robert James Waller Doctoral Fellow at the Kelley School of Business, Indiana University.

My research interests are in empirical corporate finance, particularly in understanding how financial frictions influence firm behavior and how these effects propagate to real economic outcomes.

Before joining Kelley, I earned a Bachelor's in Business Administration and Financial Engineering from Korea University, as well as a Master’s in Finance from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.

Always happy to chat about research, please reach out via <a href="mailto:chunje@iu.edu">chunje@iu.edu</a>.
