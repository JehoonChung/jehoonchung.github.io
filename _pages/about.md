Welcome! I am a second-year Finance Ph.D. student at the Kelley School of Business, Indiana University Bloomington. My research interests include corporate finance, household finance, and climate finance, with a focus on how financial decision-making associated with environmental risks affects socioeconomic outcomes. Prior to joining Kelley, I earned a B.A. and M.S. in Business Administration from Korea University as well as an M.S. in Finance from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.

You can find my CV [here](/files/CV_JehoonChung.pdf).
